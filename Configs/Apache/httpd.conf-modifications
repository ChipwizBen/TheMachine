You need to tell Apache that the default index file is index.cgi, so set DirectoryIndex to:

DirectoryIndex index.cgi

You need to tell Apache how it should handle .cgi and .pl files. Add this config:

#Handlers
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl
<Files ~ "\.pl$">
Options +ExecCGI
</Files>
<Files ~ "\.cgi$">
Options +ExecCGI
</Files>

You'll also need to setup SSL. Each installation will be different, so I won't include 
instructions. There are plenty of how tos on the internet.
