1.9.0   - Added host auto-registration process.
        - Added 'Last Successful Transfer' to Distribution Status.
        - Added the ability to use DHCP clients.
        - Fixed an alignment bug in Hosts and Sudo Users.
----------------
1.8.1   - Correctly escaped special sudoers characters (:,=) when the sudoers file is built.
        - Prevent escapes being added to commands.
        - Fixed an issue with account modification time not being updated on change.

        - System Status page implemented, which gives an overview of system settings and processes in 
          progress.
        - New distribution locking mechanism prevents two distribution processes running at the same time. 
          Distribution lock is in addition to the existing build process lock.
        - Items without notes now do not show an empty note table.
----------------
1.7.0   - Added Automated DSMS System deployment process.
        - Added the ability to allow some users read-only administrative rights.
        - Made the Account Password Reset email use admin usernames and email addresses pulled from the 
          database, instead of using static values.
        - Added the ability to specify a sending email address for password recovery emails.
----------------
1.6.0   - Fixed a bug that stripped hyphens from hostnames. Also allowed user names to contain hyphens,
          periods and underscores to match POSIX requirements.
        - Fixed a bug which allowed empty Groups to be added to the CDSF.
        - Added an automated sudoers build locking mechanism to the DSMS System to prevent two build 
          processes running at the same time.
        - Added ability to specify SFTP distribution port.
        - Added Noting System.
----------------
1.5.0   - Added MD5 checksum to Distribution Status for easier comparison with sudoers checksums 
          currently on different systems.
        - Added option to specify port in DB connection string in 'common.pl'.
        - Added the ability to specify Unix System Groups (in addition the the existing Sudo Groups) 
          which are usually defined in /etc/group.
        - Added display highlighting to differentiate between Sudo Groups and System Groups across 
          various screens.
        - Made the sudoers special host 'ALL' (meaning all hosts) a selectable option for Host Groups 
          and Hosts when attaching to a Rule.
        - Made it possible to search for Rules using the Global Search tool.
        - Made Expired Users/Hosts/Commands/Rules display as Expired instead of only Active/Inactive 
          in the Global Search tool.
        - Fixed an array allocation bug where Commands searched for through the Global Search tool 
          always returned as Active.
        - Tidied up formatting for descriptions below Add and Edit boxes - unordered lists and padding 
          is now standard across all input boxes with multi-line descriptions. 2pc left and right 
          padding is now 5px to better suit smaller screens.
        - Added Upgrade.sql file to facilitate database upgrading from 1.4.1 to 1.5.0 without needing 
          to overwrite with the Full_Schema.sql
        - Added Default_Users.sql file to simplify MySQL installation process.
        - Changed environmental-variables to environmental-defaults to avoid confusion with shell 
          environmental variables.
        - Changed Defaults Specification in environmental-defaults to use the Red Hat Defaults.
        - Added an additional 'Section Ends' comment to the end of each type section to make them 
          clearer in very large sudoers files.
        - Updated the syntax highlighting on 'index.cgi' to clearly mark each section's start and end.
        - New deployments will be shipped as .tar.gz files, as tar is installed on most Linux systems 
          by default, but unzip is not.
        - README file has been dropped in favor of new full system installation and management 
          documentation.
        - $Remote_Sudoers default value in 'common.pl' updated with new path to reflect new SFTP chroot 
          recommendations, plus added option for relative paths.
        - Added an extra error handler for distribution file push failures.
        - Dropped sha1sum from system, as it duplicated tasks already performed by md5sum.
        - Global Search now correctly displays 0 returned results when no matches are found.
        - Added Rule approval auto-revocation when any attached items are modified or deleted.
        - Added a Maintenance Mode to facilitate installations and upgrades. Maintenance Mode is 
          controlled through common.pl.
----------------
1.4.1:  - Offloaded the resolution of application paths to 'common.pl' through `which` or manual 
          override to make it more system independent.
        - Bundled required non-core modules with package (for easier installation in offline 
          environments).
        - Added recommended permissions (as a script) for files in README.
        - Adjusted the way new hosts send audit messages when they're added to make it clearer that 
          they've been added to the distribution list.
        - Added fail-safe automatic restore for broken sudoers files with the latest stored valid one.
1.4.0:  - Sudoers Distribution system is now in place through 'distribution.pl'. Individual private 
          keys, timeouts, users and remote sudoers file paths can now be specified per host.
        - Fail-safe Distribution default values are stored in 'common.pl' so that non-administrative 
          users cannot specify a remote host and overwrite an existing sudoers file, or SFTP to a 
          server using an existing key (depending on the defaults set).
        - A new Distribution Status page is available to administrative users at 
          'distribution-status.cgi'. Here, you can also manually edit a host's custom connection 
          parameters and override the defaults. 
        - Newly created hosts are now added to the new distribution table and default fail-safe 
          parameters are set.
        - Moved 'changelog.cgi' out of the Management menu, because it isn't a management tool.
----------------
1.3.1:  - Fixed a bug in the audit section of the 'sudoers-build.pl' file where each time the system 
          generated a new sudoers file it would log the successful build to the Audit Log. If 
          'sudoers-build.pl' was run from cron, a new audit entry would be created even if no changes 
          had been made to the system. Now, the system compares the checksum of the old and new files 
          and determines if a change has taken place before logging changes to the Audit Log.
        - Added storage system for old sudoers files, appended by their checksum for easier 
          identification through the Audit Log.
        - Added 'changelog.cgi' so that this changelog can be viewed in the web panel.
        - Fixed a bug in 'account-management.cgi' where it logged an audit message that an edited 
          account was locked out, even if it wasn't.
1.3.0:  - Added full Audit Log 'audit-log.cgi'. Nearly all files have been modified to integrate with the 
          new audit system.
        - Added a password salting system to increase password security (against rainbow attacks) beyond 
          the current SHA-512 hashing process to SHA-512 + 64 character salt.
        - Some general interface changes to make things a bit tidier (particularly tables).
        - Added MD5 and SHA1 checksum to sudoers file.
        - Adjusted 'Sudoers Not Found' to include links to referenced pages.
        - Added helpful descriptions to 'common.pl' components.
        - Renamed 'user-management.cgi' to 'account-management.cgi' to avoid confusing system users with 
          sudo users. Updated 'header.cgi' to reflect name change.
        - Enforced the reservation of the 'System' user name.
        - Updated account requirements description to include notice of reserved 'System' user name.
        - Added better error handling of duplicate user name and email rejections for new and edited users.
        - Fixed a bug where linked Hosts, Users and Commands were not correctly dropped from the link 
          table if they were deleted but still belonged to a Group or Rule.
        - Fixed a bug where linked Groups were not correctly dropped from the Rule to Group link table.
        - Fixed a bug in 'account-management.cgi' where an Admin that modified their own rights had their 
          access stripped for the current session only and could not reach any administrative page without 
          first logging out and back in.
        - Added syntax highlighting for potentially dangerous commands (like *).
        - Adjusted expiry column to fixed width because it was being squashed in Chrome (but not Firefox).
----------------
1.2.2:  - System now uses 'time' epoch instead of 'localtime' string for calculating expiry as the 'localtime'
          output string varied and was unreliable for calculations. 'localtime' remains in use for variables
          where a string time is specified (such as "$Date = strftime "%Y-%m-%d", localtime;").
1.2.1:  - Reduced Date::Parse module requirement from Date::Parse to Date::Parse qw(str2time).
1.2.0:  - Added expiry system. Hosts, Users, Commands, Groups and Rules can now be set to expire. Added Date::Parse to requirement list (see README).
----------------
1.1.1:  - Trimmed legacy files.
1.1.0:  - Moved environmental variables from 'sudoers-build.pl' to dedicated plain text 
          'environmental-variables' file so users don't need to edit the sudoers-build.pl script.
----------------
1.0.3:  - Renamed from Sudoers Build System to Distributed Sudoers Management System to better describe
          the system's purpose.
        - Modified 'login.cgi', 'lockout.cgi', 'header.cgi' to pull name from new subroutine in 'common.pl' 
          so the name can be easily edited to fit more easily into different customer environments.
        - Added a short name (DSMS) subroutine to 'common.pl'.
1.0.2:  - Added version numbering system to this file (hello!) and to 'common.pl'.
        - Modified 'index.cgi' to display version number.
1.0.1:  - Fixed SQL bug in 'sudoers-commands.cgi' which prevented Commands from being deleted.
1.0.0:  - Initial release.
