### This is where you should set your environmental variables.
### Formatting is exactly the same as the environmental section
### of a typical sudoers file. Some examples are provided below.
### Lines which are preceded by three hashes (###) are
### comments for this file (like this text); lines which are
### preceded by a single hash (#) become comments in the final
### sudoers file. Do not rename  or move this file.

# Defaults specification
#
# Disable "ssh hostname sudo <cmd>", because it will show the password in clear. 
#         You have to run "ssh -t hostname sudo <cmd>".

#Defaults    requiretty
#
# Refuse to run if unable to disable echo on the tty. This setting should also be
# changed in order to be able to use sudo without a tty. See requiretty above.

Defaults   !visiblepw
#
# Preserving HOME has security implications since many programs
# use it when searching for configuration files. Note that HOME
# is already set when the the env_reset option is enabled, so
# this option is only effective for configurations where either
# env_reset is disabled or HOME is present in the env_keep list.

Defaults    always_set_home
